# AGENTS.md

AI agents working in this repository must read and follow:

- [`development_instructions.md`](/workspace/development_instructions.md)

When there is conflict between local implementation habits and repository style,
follow `development_instructions.md`.

TypeScript should infer types from the `.ts` source wherever possible. Keep
hand-written declaration files to the absolute minimum for unavoidable external
or tooling shims; do not duplicate the public API in `.d.ts` files. This rule
takes priority over satisfying a lint rule by adding manual declarations.
